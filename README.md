To run this on your machine, you will need to install the requirements in the ``requirements.txt`` file using pip (inside a virtualenv if you can, as usual, to avoid sudo).

    sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy
    
Then, inside a virtualenv with access to your system site-packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
(Or, if you don't want to use virtualenv, the same but with sudo)
